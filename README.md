# tinder-bot
- Developed during the Covid-19 outbreak
    - Time efficient, undetectable.

- Requires 2 system arguements to operate
    - <code>sys.argv[1]</code>: Number of swipes per loop.
    - <code>sys.argv[2]</code>: Number of loops.

- I've included a <code>.bat</code> and a <code>.sh</code> file for ease of running the bot. The default arguements can be changed in both by simply editing the file.

    - The bot can be ran responsively in a VM (in the background) as you're working. (VM solution not implemented in the solution provided)


## Swipe responsibly
- I've made this bot as I feel it is easier to wait for the people that are interested in talking to you, before you decide if you want to talk to them, also because during the Covid-19 outbreak, most of tinder has become a nightmare to sort through via distance. 
- Enjoy responsibly.

#### Sample run
- 5 swipes
- 3 loops
